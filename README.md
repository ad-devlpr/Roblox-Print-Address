# Roblox-Print-Address
This is for a private print exploit project I'm working on to learn about roblox internals.

This might be useful to you as this repo gets **UPDATED ASAP** once roblox updates. Of-course, I will manually update the print address here every roblox update.

You can check the current roblox version at: https://clientsettings.roblox.com/v2/client-version/WindowsPlayer
& Compare it with the current_updated_version.txt to check if the address included in this repo for print is the latest.
